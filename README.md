# Mini-Projects

Welcome to my repository of mini-projects! This repository is a collection of small, fun, and educational projects that I've built to practice my coding skills and explore different technologies.

## Projects

### 1. Tic-Tac-Toe Game

The first project in this repository is a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a simple user interface where two players can take turns placing X's and O's on a 3x3 grid. The game detects winning combinations and announces the winner or a draw.

**Features:**
- Two-player game mode
- Winning pattern detection
- Draw detection
- Reset and new game buttons

### More Projects Coming Soon!

I plan to add more mini-projects to this repository as I continue learning and exploring different programming concepts and technologies. Stay tuned for updates!

## Getting Started

To run any of the projects locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

2. Navigate to the project directory you want to run.

3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

Alternatively, you can use a local development server like Live Server (VS Code extension) or serve the project using a simple HTTP server like Python's `http.server` module or Node.js's `http-server` package.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank the open-source community for providing valuable resources, tutorials, and inspiration for these mini-projects. Special thanks to the creators of the technologies used in each project.
