# Mini-Projects

Welcome to my repository of mini-projects! This repository is a collection of small, fun, and educational projects that I've built to practice my coding skills and explore different technologies.

## Projects

### 1. Tic-Tac-Toe Game

The first project in this repository is a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a simple user interface where two players can take turns placing X's and O's on a 3x3 grid. The game detects winning combinations and announces the winner or a draw.

**Features:**
- Two-player game mode
- Winning pattern detection
- Draw detection
- Reset and new game buttons

### 2. Rock Paper Scissors Game

This project is a classic Rock Paper Scissors game where you compete against the computer. The game keeps track of your score and the computer's score on the scoreboard. Choose your move and see if you can outsmart the computer!

**Features:**
- Single-player game mode against the computer
- Score tracking on the scoreboard
- User-friendly interface

**Note:** Both games are responsive, but they are optimized for desktop usage. While you can play them on mobile devices, the experience may be better on desktop.

### More Projects Coming Soon!

I plan to add more mini-projects to this repository as I continue learning and exploring different programming concepts and technologies. Stay tuned for updates!
